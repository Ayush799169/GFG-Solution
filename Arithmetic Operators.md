### Problem Description

**Task:** Given two integer variables x and y, perform the following operations:p: Addition of x and yq: Subtraction of y from xr: Multiplication of x and ys: Floating-point division of x by yt: Integer division of x by yu: Modulo (remainder when x is divided by y)Examples:Input: x = 1, y = 2

#### Examples

##### Example 1

- **Output:**
```text
3 -1 2 0.500 0 1
```
- **Explanation:** The given operations are performed:Addition of x and y = 3Subtraction of y from x = -1Multiplication of x and y = 2Floating-point division of x by y = 0.500Integer division of x by y = 0Modulo of x and y = 1Hence, the output is 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1.

##### Example 2

- **Input:**
```text
x = 3, y = 4
```
- **Output:**
```text
7 -1 12 0.750 0 3
```
- **Explanation:** The given operations are performed.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1)

```cpp
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

          int p=x+y, q=x-y, r=x*y, t=x/y ,u=x%y;
          double s=(double)x/y;

    cout << p << " " << q << " " << r << " " << fixed << setprecision(3) << s << " "
         << t << " " << u;

    return 0;
}
```
